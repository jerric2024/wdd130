      <p>
        My <b>mission</b> is to help my clients become financially savvy in understanding how to make and manage sound financial decisions.
        My business promotes a simplified <b>approach</b> to finance and encourages financial responsibility from all parties. I should never be the 
        smartest one in the room and will always strive to achieve greater <b>value</b> through a collective understanding of the financial situations at hand.

      </ul>
      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        My business <b>values</b> diversity and drives a culture of inclusion, development, and balanced success. I don’t want my clients to feel that they have to depend on me 
        for their own success. My job is to work with them and help them to achieve success themselves. I add <b>value</b> when, as a team, we are able to capitalize on more 
        than one idea and find creative solutions to financial concerns.

      </ul>
      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>
        My <b>approach</b> is to partner with my customers to help them achieve success with their own financial goals; I will not work for them, but will work with them; 
        they will drive, and I will instruct on what, how, and where. I provide personalized attention to financial strategies and decisions.
      </p><p>  
        I am looking to build relationships founded on my clients’ success. If they are not achieving the success that they desire with my support, they can let me go and 
        hire a different professional to manage their portfolio. My <b>approach</b> is always to help my client manage their own portfolio and to do that successfully.
