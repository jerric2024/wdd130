        Do you struggle with financial items?  Are debits and credits as foreign to you as distant lands and unknown languages?  You are not alone.  
        Many hard-working business owners, just like yourself, struggle with finding time to worry about whether their money is invested correctly, or if 
        they are using the right types of bank accounts, or how to improve their credit rating.  
        Let us help!  My name is Jeremy Stout. I’m a financial specialist, or, in simpler terms, a <i>financialist</i>. I’ve been working in the finance industry 
        for over 25 years and know a thing or two about how to manage money.  From day-to-day accounting to corporate treasury operations, I have 
        a broad spectrum of real-world finance experience and skills that are fit for any business.  Personal banking, investments, project management, 
        financial analysis...these are all acquired skills that I can apply to common business scenarios using common, everyday terminology.  
        My business promotes a simplified approach to finance and encourages hands-on financial learning from all parties. I am never the smartest 
        one in the room and always strive to collaborate with others to achieve greater value through a collective understanding of the financial situations 
        we face.  In other words, I <b>value</b> your opinion and perspectives and think that you hold the keys to your own financial success.  You just need someone 
        to help you with how to <b>approach</b> it, and that is where I come in.

      </ul>
      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
        My business <b>values</b> diverse thinking and promotes a culture of inclusion, development, and balanced success. Your skills as a business owner have 
        brought you far on the path to success.  Because of that, you already know more about finance than you might think.  Let me help you find the 
        connection between your passion in business and the required structure that will keep it alive.
        Let’s start building from where you are.  What do you know today about finance and how are you applying that knowledge with your business?  
        Let’s develop a plan on how to get from where you are today to where you want to be in a year, or five years.  A strong business plan and strategy 
        is the start to any successful business.  I will help you to interweave financial strength into those plans and strategies.    
        My goal is your success.  If you succeed, we all do. Each day needs to focus on how to be more successful than the day before. Each transaction should 
        add to the reservoir of knowledge that comes through your hands-on experience with your financial transactions.  I must help you to build a strong 
        foundation of confidence in making financial decisions.

      </ul>
      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>
        The way that I <b>approach</b> relationships with my customers is through a spirit of partnership.  My goal is to help you achieve success with your own 
        financial goals.  I don’t see myself as working for you; but instead, I am working with you.  Somewhat like teaching another person how to drive.  
        There is only one driver in the car and the student (or the business owner) is required to be at the wheel.  The instructor (me) is there to help 
        guide and encourage the student in the decisions that are being made.  I am there to help anticipate any problems that might arise and to bring that 
        awareness to you, my client, while also providing options on how to avoid any pitfalls.
        Of course, as with a moving vehicle, the wrong financial decisions can have far-reaching effects.   My approach, then, is to prepare my clients with an 
        understanding of what they might expect on the street. Each day I develop a specific financial plan and work with my clients to ensure that this plan is 
        achievable and fits into their busy schedules.  
        I build relationships based on my clients’ success. If they are not achieving the success that they desire with my support, they can always let me go 
        and hire a different professional to manage their portfolio. My approach, though, is to always help my client manage their own portfolio and to do that 
        successfully.
