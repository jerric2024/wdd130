        <p>Hello!  I'm Jeremy Stout.  I am excited to be in this course and to start designing web pages.
            I am also excited to get to know and work with each of you during the next 14 weeks.</p>
        <p>A little about me...I am originally from Provo, Utah (grew up there as a child), but have lived
            most of my life between Mesa, Arizona and Southern California.  I currently live in Orange County, 
            California with my wife, Liliana, and our oldest daughter and youngest son.  I have three other adult
            children who currently live in Mesa, Arizona</p>
        <p>The thing that I like to do the most during any of my free time is to spend it with my family.
            We love to travel, spend time at the beach, go camping, or just to hang out together at home. 
            We also love to help and serve others and find a lot of opportunity to do that through the church</p>
        <p>My wife and I have been active members of the church since we were 8 years old. My wife is from
            Juarez, Mexico.  I had the blessing of serving a mission in Buenos Aires Argentina.  Together, we
            continue serving within the Latino community here in Orange County as much as we can.  It is a great
            blessing in our lives to be able to love and serve with our brothers and sisters in the church,
            wherever we are.</p>
        <p>I am so very grateful for BYU Pathway as it has opened many doors for me and for those with whom I
            serve to be able to study and progress toward a professional degree.  I am pursuing a degree in Applied
            Technology.  I currently work as a Financial Analyst for a large corporation and feel that a
            degree in Programming and Web Development will help to not only advance my career in finance,
            but also will help to improve how I serve and work with others each day.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes is from our prophet during the last general conference.  He said, "...
            here is the grand truth: while the world insists that power, possessions, popularity, and pleasures
            of the flesh bring happiness, they do not! They cannot! What they do produce is nothing but a hollow
            substitute for “the blessed and happy state of those [who] keep the commandments of God.” The truth is
            that it is much more exhausting to seek happiness where you can never find it!"
            (Nelson, Russell M. "Overcome the World and Find Rest." General Conference, Oct 2022.)</p>
